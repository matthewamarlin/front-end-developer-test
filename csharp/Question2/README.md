# Height and Age Classifier

## Outline
The task for this project is to create a basic application that takes a persons age and height as inputs and then classifies them as Child, Teenager, Adult, Senior and then as Short, Average, Tall.

## Requirements
Any language/s can be used, but there must be the following included:
- A UI which accepts age and height (May be a console app)
- A button to classify the persons
- An output which displays the results (e.g. Adult & Short)

## Inputs
Age is a positive integer  
Height is a positive decimal value

## Process
A user will input the age and height to be classified, the application must then output the person based on their descriptions

## Outputs

A classification of the input (e.g. Child & Tall, Teenager & Short etc)

## Notes

The age and height classifications can be assumed by you. i.e. it is up to you to determine what a Child is, and what being Short is.
